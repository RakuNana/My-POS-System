A simple POS System I'm currently working on. I'm trying to copy the functionality of a system I use at work. The system in question allows employees to enter and ID code, clock in and out , get table numbers, menu items , calculate cost , and much much more. I figured what better way to learn to program then , to copy an exsiting software that already exsit and was paid for with real money.

what I used to code:

Atom IDE
Mysql
Python3.8


feel free to use this code as a study guide. I'm sure it will be useful to somebody :)
